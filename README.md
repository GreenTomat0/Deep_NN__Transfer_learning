<h3>Deep Convolutional Network with Transfer Learning (MobileNetV2)</h3>

<p>This project aims to train a binary classifier to distinguish between <i>alpaca</i> and <i>non-alpaca</i>.</p>

<p>The model leverages <b>MobileNetV2</b>, a pre-trained deep convolutional neural network trained on the ImageNet dataset (~14 million images across 1000 classes). By applying transfer learning, we adapt the model to the new binary classification task.</p>

<p>To enhance performance and reduce overfitting, <b>data augmentation</b> techniques are applied to the alpaca dataset.</p>
